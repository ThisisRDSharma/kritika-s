Data transformation in this context is achieved by aggregating, mapping, and categorizing the data using objective business rules. This approach allows the system to organize and structure the input data, such as identity information and verification results, to align with predefined criteria for identity verification.

Since the Trulioo eIDV process is rule-based and not model-driven, data transformation primarily focuses on applying these rules to process incoming data (e.g., verifying identity details, matching documents, and checking for discrepancies), rather than using techniques like machine learning or data sampling.
