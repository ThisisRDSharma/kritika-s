Gross Basis Points (Gross BPS):
Gross Basis Points measure fraud losses as a percentage of total transaction volume, expressed in basis points (bps), where 1 bps equals 0.01%. It is calculated as (Fraud Losses / Total Transaction Volume) × 10,000. A lower Gross BPS indicates stronger fraud prevention, while a higher value suggests increased exposure to fraud risks.

Transaction Approval Ratio:
The Transaction Approval Ratio represents the percentage of transactions that are approved out of the total attempted transactions. It is calculated as (Approved Transactions / Total Transactions Attempted) × 100. A higher approval ratio enhances customer experience by minimizing transaction declines, but an excessively high approval rate may indicate lenient fraud controls, increasing fraud risk.s.
