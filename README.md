Limited Applicability: The model is tailored for specific product types, geographies, and transaction types. Applying the model to other segments can lead to unreliable results, as it may not capture the unique characteristics or risks associated with those segments.
Performance Degradation: Significant changes to the product portfolio or transaction types could cause the model's predictive accuracy to decline, potentially leading to false positives or missed fraud cases.
