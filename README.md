The Trulioo eIDV process is a rule-based system, not a machine learning or statistical model, and therefore does not require traditional stability or overfitting testing. There are no estimated relationships or training datasets that could lead to overfitting in the conventional sense.

Instead, the stability of the system is maintained through:

Business Rule Validation: Predefined rules are rigorously tested for consistency and robustness during client-specific testing.
Data Source Monitoring: Stability is ensured by continually validating the accuracy and reliability of the data sources (e.g., government databases, credit records).
Periodic Updates: Regular updates to data sources and business rules ensure that the system remains effective over time, even as verification needs evolve.
