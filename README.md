This assumption is fundamental because the model’s predictive accuracy and reliability are contingent upon receiving high-quality data. If the data inputs are compromised, the model’s output will also be affected, leading to erroneous conclusions and decisions. By assuming that clients and processors will provide complete and accurate data, the model design and validation processes can focus on optimizing performance under the expectation that the data environment remains robust. Any deviation from this assumption would necessitate additional data validation, error handling, and potential model recalibration.
