The Trulioo eIDV process follows a structured set of steps to ensure identity verification is conducted accurately and efficiently. Below is a general step-by-step guide for running the system, including input validation, processing, and output verification:

1. Input Data Extraction
Collect input data from the client’s system or onboarding process. Inputs may include:
Personal information: Name, address, date of birth, email, phone number.
Document information: Passport number, national ID, or driver's license.
Ensure the data format aligns with Trulioo’s specifications (e.g., names in text format, dates in YYYY-MM-DD format).
2. Checking the Correctness of Input Data
Validate the completeness and accuracy of input data:
Check for missing fields or invalid formats (e.g., improperly formatted phone numbers or invalid email addresses).
Ensure data is compatible with the system’s predefined requirements for verification.
Flag incomplete or incorrect data for manual correction or re-submission.
3. Checking Model Assumptions and Settings
Review system settings to ensure the correct rules and assumptions are applied:
Verify matching thresholds (e.g., percentage match required for name and address fields).
Confirm the prioritization of trusted data sources, such as government databases and credit bureaus.
Ensure any client-specific customizations, such as regional settings or regulatory compliance requirements, are correctly configured.
4. Initiating the Processing Component
Begin the identity verification process by triggering the API call to Trulioo’s platform.
Monitor the processing progress through system logs or API response tracking to ensure the process runs smoothly.
5. Checking for Successful Completion
Verify that the system has completed processing without errors:
Use API response codes or system logs to confirm that all identity checks have been executed successfully.
Investigate and resolve any errors or interruptions before proceeding to output validation.
6. Extracting Model Outputs
Retrieve the outputs generated by the system. Outputs typically include:
Verification Results: Verified, Not Verified, or Attention.
Match Details: Field-level matches or discrepancies for inputs such as name, address, and date of birth.
Error Reports: Details on any flagged issues or mismatches.
7. Validating Model Outputs
Review the outputs to ensure they align with the predefined business rules and criteria:
Check that verification results (e.g., Verified, Not Verified, Attention) match the expected outcomes based on the input data.
Ensure flagged cases are escalated for manual review or additional checks by compliance teams.
