Applicable Policies and Regulations for Trulioo eIDV Model
The Trulioo eIDV (Electronic Identity Verification) model aligns with BSA (Bank Secrecy Act) regulatory requirements, supporting digital banking and non-resident alien customer identification as part of a Customer Identification Program (CIP).

Compliance with BSA Requirements:
The model is designed to collect necessary information about customers, including government-issued identification for international customers. This ensures adherence to Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements.

Mismatch Escalation:
In cases where mismatches occur during the identity verification process, the model escalates these cases to the BSA OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control) group for review and resolution. This process supports compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) mandates under BSA regulations.
