The output for the Trulioo eIDV process is categorized as Verified, Not Verified, Attention, or combinations of Pass, Fail, and Attention based on the results of the identity verification checks. These outputs are determined by comparing the applicant’s submitted data (e.g., personal details, government-issued documents) against trusted data sources, with the results aligned to predetermined thresholds and rules.

Verified: This indicates a successful match between the submitted data and trusted data sources, confirming the individual’s identity.
Not Verified: The identity cannot be validated due to mismatches or insufficient data from trusted sources.
Attention: The result is ambiguous, requiring further review or manual intervention, often due to incomplete or conflicting information.
