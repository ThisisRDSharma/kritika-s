The segmentation approach for SecuRLock using FICO scores focuses on differentiating transaction risk across credit and debit card portfolios in EWB. For credit cards, it assesses card-present and card-not-present transactions, incorporating factors like merchant name, transaction amount. For debit cards, segmentation includes signature-based (card-present and not-present) and PIN transactions, leveraging FICO scores to enhance fraud detection by identifying high-risk patterns across these categories.
