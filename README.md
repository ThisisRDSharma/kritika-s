The Trulioo eIDV process does not use machine learning or statistical models; therefore, traditional statistical and technical assumption testing (such as residual analysis or testing for multicollinearity) is not applicable. Instead, the process relies on predefined business rules and logic for identity verification. These rules are tested through comprehensive client-specific testing, ensuring that match criteria align with permissible purposes and regulatory requirements.
The Trulioo eIDV process is a rule-based system, not a statistical or machine learning model, and therefore does not involve statistical or technical assumption testing as part of its operation. The system's logic is predefined through business rules, which are deterministic and do not rely on probabilistic assumptions or statistical residual analysis typically associated with such testing

As the Trulioo eIDV process operates as a rule-based system, traditional performance or fit testing methods used in statistical models (e.g., R-squared, p-values) are not applicable. 
The Trulioo eIDV process does not involve model performance or fit testing in the traditional sense, as it does not use a trained statistical or machine learning model. Instead, the process operates through the application of rule-based logic to verify identities against trusted data sources.
