Judgmental adjustments involve expert human input to modify the output of a process or model. 
So far, no management overrides have been required or implemented, as the process relies on the predefined rules and expert judgment during manual reviews when needed​.

Model overlays generally refer to the additional layers or models applied to the primary model’s output to adjust or refine its predictions. The Trulioo eIDV process does not rely on model overlays in the traditional sense, as it operates using a rule-based system rather than a machine learning or statistical model.
