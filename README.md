1.Improved detection accuracy across a wide range of document types.

2.Robustness in detecting subtle and advanced tampering techniques.
Tamper detection should check for any physical modifications to a document, including photo substitution and font manipulation;
digital alterations also, such as the use of an image manipulation tool (which should be identifiable in pixel-by-pixel detail and
flagged, highlighting the tool used to edit the document). It should also check for data alterations identified by cryptographic
assessment of chip data present in an ePassport.
