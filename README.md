OAuth (Open Authorization) and mTLS (Mutual Transport Layer Security) are security protocols designed to ensure robust, secure, and trustworthy data exchange in online verification and communication systems, such as Trulioo's global identity verification platform. Here's how they are used:

1. OAuth (Open Authorization):
OAuth is a widely adopted authorization framework that allows applications to access user data securely without exposing sensitive information such as passwords.

Purpose:
Secure delegated access, where third-party services can request limited access to user resources without requiring login credentials.
Minimize risk of credential theft during authorization.
Use in Verification:
Ensures user consent and secure authorization during identity verification processes, preventing unauthorized data access.
2. mTLS (Mutual Transport Layer Security):
mTLS is an extension of TLS (used in HTTPS) that requires both the server and the client to authenticate each other via digital certificates.

Purpose:
Provides an additional layer of trust by confirming the identities of both parties in a connection.
Protects data integrity and confidentiality during communication.
Use in Verification:
Ensures that data exchanged between the verification platform (like Trulioo) and its clients or users is secure and comes from authenticated sources.
Mitigates risks like man-in-the-middle attacks.
By using OAuth and mTLS, Trulioo establishes a secure, compliant, and trusted framework for conducting worldwide identity verification. This ensures regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and enhances user privacy and data security. Let me know if further details are needed!

Identity and document verification involve the exchange of sensitive data like government-issued ID details, biometrics, and cryptographic information. Both OAuth and mTLS:
Safeguard against unauthorized access and ensure that only authenticated systems can participate in the verification process.
