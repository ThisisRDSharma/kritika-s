Data
Assumption Description
The Chinese National ID database leveraged by the Trulioo eIDV process is assumed to be actively updated, ensuring that it includes the most recent and accurate identity information for verification purposes.
Materiality of Assumption
Up-to-date data reduces the likelihood of mismatches or verification errors, ensuring accurate results during the eIDV process.
Rationale for this Assumption
This assumption is critical to the reliability of the Trulioo eIDV process in verifying Chinese nationals. It directly affects the system’s ability to deliver accurate, timely, and compliant identity verification results.

Model
Adequate Data Source Coverage for NRA Verification
Assumption Description
It is assumed that the data sources maintained or integrated by Trulioo provide sufficient coverage and accuracy for verifying Non-Resident Alien (NRA) applicants during the identity verification process.
Materiality of Assumption
Insufficient coverage could lead to verification failures, regulatory non-compliance, or a poor customer experience, especially in global markets with varying data source quality.
Rationale for this Assumption
Trulioo’s ability to support large-scale onboarding processes, especially for NRAs, relies on the assumption that the integrated data sources offer sufficient population coverage and data accuracy for diverse markets.
