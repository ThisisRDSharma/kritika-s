In the context of Secure Lock and the FICO model, data reconciliation ensures that the data used for model development aligns with production data. This process includes validating the presence of required data, ensuring valid values, and checking for completeness. Raw data is cleansed based on predefined conditions and reconciled to ensure consistency across datasets. Fraudulent and non-fraudulent data are sampled and reviewed for accuracy before being handed over to the modeling team for further validation. A data specification document ensures that all necessary data elements are included, and model variables are chosen based on their statistical significance to enhance model performance.
