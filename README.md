We have a monitoring plan in place for both debit and credit cards, with data sourced internally and monitored at specified intervals. The vendor calculates debit and credit card metrics on a monthly basis.

The percentage of fraudulent transactions successfully prevented by the model, calculated by comparing the number of blocked fraudulent transactions to total fraud attempts, including transactions that were later confirmed as fraudulent through customer claims.

Fraud Prevention Rate (Not Including Claims Data)
The percentage of fraudulent transactions successfully blocked by the model, measured against total fraud attempts but excluding transactions that were later identified as fraudulent through customer claims.

Valid Accounts Real-Time Declined
The number of legitimate customer accounts that experienced real-time transaction declines due to suspected fraud, despite being valid and non-fraudulent.

Valid Authorizations Real-Time Declined
The number or legitimate transactions that were declined in real-time by the fraud prevention model, even though they were authorized and not fraudulent.

Average Approved Fraud Transactions per Account

Average Approved Fraud Dollar per Account
