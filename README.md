In-time backtesting refers to evaluating the system's performance by comparing the results generated by the eIDV process against actual historical outcomes for the same time period. 

Out-of-time backtesting evaluates the eIDV process on datasets from future or unseen time periods to test its robustness and performance in changing conditions.
