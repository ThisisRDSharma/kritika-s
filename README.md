Regular assessments should be conducted to evaluate whether the model is leveraging a sufficiently diverse and representative dataset for fraud detection. Any gaps or limitations in data sources should be identified and addressed through periodic reviews.

If discrepancies are observed, further analysis should be performed to assess the impact on model performance, and corrective actions should be considered.
