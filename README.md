The identity verification process in Trulioo eIDV is entirely rule-based, relying on predefined business rules and logic to ensure compliance and transparency in verifying structured data like names and addresses. As a result, machine learning (ML) is not used for identity verification. However, Trulioo's document verification process employs AI/ML techniques to detect tampering, validate security features, and process image data more effectively.
