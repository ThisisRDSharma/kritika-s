For the Trulioo eIDV process, there are no traditional model formulas or algorithms used, as the system is based on rule-based logic rather than machine learning or statistical modeling. Therefore, there are no complex numerical techniques or formulas, such as regression equations, decision trees, or clustering algorithms, typically associated with predictive modeling.

Instead, the eIDV process operates through predefined business rules applied to incoming data. These rules determine whether a given identity matches or is verified based on information such as personal details, government-issued documents, and external data sources.
