While specific stress testing or scenario analysis data for SecurLOCK is unavailable, the sensitivity analysis results can provide valuable insights for scenario analysis. Since FICO has evaluated the modelâ€™s performance impact when key fields are blanked out at specified percentage rates, these findings can be leveraged to simulate different operational scenarios. By analyzing how variations in input data affect model outcomes, we can approximate potential stress conditions and assess model stability under adverse conditions
