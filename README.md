We have two monitoring plans in place. The first is EWB's quarterly monitoring plan, which includes metrics such as the False Positive Rate (FPR) and Real-Time Dollar Decline. The second is the vendor's monitoring plan, where metrics like the FPR ratio, Fraud Prevention Rate, Average Approved Transactions per Account, and Valid Accounts Real-Time Declined are monitored on a monthly basis.

The following debit card metrics are internally generated by EWB. Clarification is required on whether to include EWB RT dollar decline metrics, as they do not contribute to performance assessment.

Real-Time Dollar Declined
The total dollar amount of transactions that were declined in real-time due to suspected fraud, based on the fraud prevention model’s decisioning criteria.

Fraud Prevention Rate (Including Claims Data)
The percentage of fraudulent transactions successfully prevented by the model, calculated by comparing the number of blocked fraudulent transactions to total fraud attempts, including transactions that were later confirmed as fraudulent through customer claims.

Fraud Prevention Rate (Not Including Claims Data)
The percentage of fraudulent transactions successfully blocked by the model, measured against total fraud attempts but excluding transactions that were later identified as fraudulent through customer claims.

Valid Accounts Real-Time Declined
The number of legitimate customer accounts that experienced real-time transaction declines due to suspected fraud, despite being valid and non-fraudulent.

Valid Authorizations Real-Time Declined
The number or legitimate transactions that were declined in real-time by the fraud prevention model, even though they were authorized and not fraudulent.

Average Approved Fraud Transactions per Account
The average number of fraudulent transactions that were incorrectly approved per customer account, indicating the model’s effectiveness in preventing unauthorized transactions.

Average Approved Fraud Dollar per Account
The average dollar amount of fraudulent transactions that were mistakenly approved per customer account, representing potential fraud losses due to false negatives in the fraud prevention model.
