Although the Trulioo eIDV process is not a traditional predictive model, it functions as a rule-based tool for identity verification. Below is the working structure of the process:
The ID verification tool uses Trulioo's Global Gateway database, a comprehensive repository of global data sources, to validate user-provided information. The rule-based system cross-references input details like name, address, and date of birth against this database to produce verification results.

Verification Outcomes:

Match: Input data aligns completely with Global Gateway records.
No Match: Discrepancies exist between the input and database information.
Missing: Certain fields are incomplete or unavailable in the database.
Hidden: Data exists but is restricted due to privacy or regulatory limitations.
