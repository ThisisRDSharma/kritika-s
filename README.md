The key output of the Trulioo eIDV process is the identity verification result, which is returned to the client after the system compares the input data (such as name, address, date of birth) against trusted data sources (e.g., government databases, credit bureaus). 
If there are any mismatches or issues with the identity verification check these issues trigger alerts for the BSA team (Bank Secrecy Act), who is responsible for manually reviewing flagged applications to assess whether they meet regulatory standards.
