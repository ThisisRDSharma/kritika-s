“The Post-Implementation Validation process ensures the model operates as intended in the live environment and establishes benchmarks for its expected performance. These benchmarks, along with identified performance metrics and thresholds, form the foundation of the ongoing Performance Monitoring framework. Insights from post-implementation validation guide the identification of potential risks, enabling timely corrective actions and continuous improvement during the monitoring phase.”
