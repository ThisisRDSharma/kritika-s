For the Trulioo eIDV process, various methodologies could potentially be employed to implement the identity verification framework. These methods may yield variations in results, which are not necessarily correct or incorrect but can be judged as better or worse based on expert evaluation and performance benchmarks. While benchmarking results are comparable across methodologies, they may not be identical due to differences in approach. Specific alternative approaches were not documented in the materials provided.
