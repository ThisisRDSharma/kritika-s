In the Trulioo eIDV process, benchmarking results are designed to be comparable across different datasets and implementations. However, due to variability in client-specific rule sets, data demographics, and the availability of data sources, the results may not be exactly the same in all cases. This variability ensures that benchmarking reflects realistic performance under diverse conditions while highlighting areas for potential optimization in specific use cases.
