Hello Charles,

Good day to you.

I appreciate your time and support in providing the necessary details for the model documentation. As part of the ongoing discussion, could you please share information on model access & security and model key stakeholders for FIS SecurLock? These aspects were outlined in the requirement list shared earlier.

Please let me know if any clarifications are needed.

Best regards,
Rishabh Dutt
