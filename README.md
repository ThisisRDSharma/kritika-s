Data sampling is not relevant for the Trulioo eIDV process, as it is a rule-based system rather than a model-based one. Since the eIDV process uses predefined rules and data sources for identity verification, it does not require sampling for model training or validation.

Data sampling is the process of selecting a subset of data from a larger dataset to make statistical inferences or train machine learning models.
