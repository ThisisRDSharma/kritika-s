 Increased Risk of Missing Fraud Patterns: The effectiveness of fraud detection models in Secure Lock may be reduced if the amount of consortium data leveraged is limited. Without access to a broad set of data from multiple institutions, the system might miss out on identifying emerging fraud schemes that are detected elsewhere.
Potential for Higher False Positives/Negatives: Limited consortium data may lead to less accurate fraud risk scores, potentially increasing the number of false positives (legitimate transactions flagged as fraud) or false negatives (fraudulent transactions not detected).
