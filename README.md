Assumption Description
The Trulioo eIDV model relies on data sources that are frequently updated to ensure relevance, accuracy, and alignment with evolving regulatory and client requirements. These updates address emerging client needs and enhance the model's effectiveness in identity verification processes.

Rationale for This Assumption
Dynamic Compliance Needs: Regulatory frameworks and verification requirements for digital identity are constantly changing globally, necessitating frequent updates to data sources.
Evolving Fraud Patterns: New fraud techniques require access to the latest and most relevant datasets to maintain robust verification capabilities.
Client Diversity: Trulioo's global client base includes entities with varying requirements, driving the need for a versatile and up-to-date data pool to support region-specific and industry-specific use cases.
Materiality of the Assumption
High Materiality: The frequent updating of data sources is critical to ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the Trulioo eIDV model. Without these updates, the model's ability to perform effective identity verification could be compromised, leading to higher false negatives or positives, regulatory non-compliance, and reduced client trust.
