We have two monitoring plans in place. The first is EWB's quarterly monitoring plan, which includes metrics such as the False Positive Rate (FPR) and Real-Time Dollar Decline. The second is the vendor's monitoring plan, where metrics like the FPR ratio, Fraud Prevention Rate, Average Approved Transactions per Account, and Valid Accounts Real-Time Declined are monitored on a monthly basis.

The following debit card metrics are internally generated by EWB. Clarification is required on whether to include EWB RT dollar decline metrics, as they do not contribute to performance assessment.
