The eIDV system's outputs are determined by predefined business rules and logic, not by adjustable parameters or statistical estimations. As a result, sensitivity analysis, which typically measures how the variation in model parameters affects the output, does not apply to this rule-based approach.
However, rule adjustments can be made as needed based on expert judgment, client feedback, or changes in data sources, but these are not part of a formal sensitivity analysis process.


Stress testing and scenario analysis are typically used to assess the robustness of predictive models under extreme or unforeseen conditions. Since the Trulioo eIDV process is rule-based, stress testing and scenario analysis do not apply in the traditional sense. However, the system undergoes comprehensive testing and client-specific testing to ensure that it performs effectively across a variety of real-world scenarios, including different data sets, risk profiles, and regulatory requirements.

While the eIDV process is designed to handle variations in input data, including edge cases (e.g., incomplete or ambiguous records), the focus is on applying predefined rules consistently across diverse conditions, rather than simulating stress scenarios as would be done for machine learning models.
