Benchmark Rate (Including Claims Data)
The benchmark fraud rate that serves as a performance standard, calculated by considering both real-time fraud prevention data and post-transaction fraud claims. This rate helps assess the effectiveness of the fraud prevention model in identifying fraudulent activity, including cases detected through customer disputes and chargebacks.

Benchmark Rate (Not Including Claims Data)
The benchmark fraud rate based solely on real-time fraud detection, excluding fraud cases identified through customer claims. This metric provides insight into the modelâ€™s initial fraud detection capability without adjustments for post-transaction fraud identification.

Decline Rate
The percentage of total transactions that are declined by the fraud prevention model due to suspected fraudulent activity. It is a key indicator of how aggressively the model is filtering potential fraud, balancing fraud prevention with customer experience.
