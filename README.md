"The development data for the Acuant model has been meticulously curated to ensure comprehensive coverage of document types and robust detection capabilities for tampering. By leveraging AssureID’s extensive database of over 3,400 document types—including driver’s licenses, birth certificates, passports, and digital identity tokens—the model achieves enhanced detection accuracy across a wide spectrum of use cases. Simultaneously, its tampering detection mechanisms incorporate advanced techniques to identify both physical modifications, such as photo substitution and font manipulation, and digital alterations, such as cryptographic discrepancies in ePassport chip data."

1.Improved detection accuracy across a wide range of document types.

2.Robustness in detecting subtle and advanced tampering techniques.
Tamper detection should check for any physical modifications to a document, including photo substitution and font manipulation;
digital alterations also, such as the use of an image manipulation tool (which should be identifiable in pixel-by-pixel detail and
flagged, highlighting the tool used to edit the document). It should also check for data alterations identified by cryptographic
assessment of chip data present in an ePassport.
