The model segmentation in iProov was based on key demographics, including age groups (18–30, 31–50, 51–60, 60+), gender (Male, Female), and ethnicity (Black, East Asian, South Asian, White), to ensure fair and unbiased performance across diverse user groups. Data for each demographic was collected over the months of April, May, and June. For each demographic group, the most commonly used devices during this period were identified, and transactions were sampled to maintain equal representation across demographics, devices (Dynamic Android, Dynamic iOS, Dynamic Web), and months. This balanced approach avoided overrepresentation of any specific group and ensured the model captured diverse user behaviors.

Segmentation was structured to account for performance differences across devices and demographics. Analysis revealed small or no overlap in pass rate confidence intervals for ethnicities on Dynamic Android, attributed to regional differences in phone model distributions. For Dynamic iOS, a slight dip in performance for users aged 18–30 was linked to bright sunlight conditions during authentication. For Dynamic Web, lower pass rates for the 60+ age group were attributed to differences in device quality, as normalization by manufacturer was not feasible.

This demographic-based segmentation ensured that the data was representative of the user base, enabling the model to identify and address disparities in performance metrics. The impact of this approach was significant, leading to improved fairness and reduced bias in model estimation. By balancing representation across demographics and analyzing pass rates and confidence intervals, the segmentation allowed for targeted adjustments, ensuring robust and equitable model outputs for all user groups.
