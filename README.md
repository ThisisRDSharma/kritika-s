The Trulioo eIDV process is a rule-based system and does not utilize machine learning or statistical models, so traditional in-sample performance or fit testing is not applicable. The system operates deterministically, applying predefined business rules to verify identities against trusted data sources.

Since the eIDV process does not involve model training, the concept of out-of-sample testing (where unseen data from the same time period is used to evaluate performance) is not directly applicable.

In the absence of machine learning models, out-of-time testing (evaluating performance on data from a future time period) is not relevant to the Trulioo eIDV process. The system's reliance on regularly updated data sources ensures it remains current and effective over time.
